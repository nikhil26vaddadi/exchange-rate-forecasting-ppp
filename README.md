# exchange-rate-forecasting-ppp
This project analyzes the **US–Japan exchange rate** (1995–2024) and tests the **Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) hypothesis** using econometric and time series methods.   It combines **absolute and relative PPP tests** with **Box–Jenkins ARIMA modelling** to evaluate long-term vs short-term exchange rate behavior.
